# Storybook of mpoblete-components for React components

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from business logic, data, and your application's context. This makes developing hard-to-reach states easier. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit them during development, testing, or quality control.

Explore example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
Check out their code in the `./stories` directory to see how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process that starts with atomic components and ends with pages.

## How to create a reusable component?

Storybook automatically exports components entered within the `./src/components/index.ts` path. Any component not exported within this index file won't be extractable from the `@mpoblete/react-ui` library.

### Component Example

How to create a story for my component?
Storybook allows creating stories related to our components. All parameters of our component can be edited and viewed in real-time.

Example component:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import "../styles/index.scss";
import { MyComponentProps } from "../interfaces";

export const MyComponent: React.FC<MyComponentProps> = ({
  title = "Default Title",
  content,
  onAction,
  isDisabled = false,
  size = "medium",
  theme = "default",
}) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={`my-component ${size} ${theme} ${
        isDisabled ? "disabled" : ""
      }`}
      onClick={!isDisabled ? onAction : undefined}
      data-testid="my-component"
    >
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <p>{content}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Add Interfaces and Types

Define your component properties using interfaces and types to ensure consistency and autocompletion in your code editor. This also makes maintaining and scaling your code easier.

```tsx
export interface MyComponentProps {
  title?: string;
  content?: string;
  onAction?: () => void;
  isDisabled?: boolean;
  size?: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  theme?: "default" | "primary" | "secondary";
}
```

## To style components in Storybook

you can import CSS or SCSS files directly into your component files or stories. Make sure to maintain an organized folder structure for styles, separating global styles from component-specific ones.

```tsx
import "../styles/my-component.scss";

export const StyledComponent: React.FC = () => (
  <div className="my-component custom-style">Hello World</div>
);
```

## You can create your own CSS file.

```tsx
.my-component {
  padding: 1rem;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

```
